# Mistral-7B-Unsloth-TRL

### In the code given we have fine tuned Imdb datset using mistral 7B Quantized model incorporating UNSLOTH for faster fine tuning. The approach which we used is SFT( supervised fined tuning ) which is available from a library called TRL (Transformer reinforcement learning) and used FAST LoRa weigths.
